App
-----
logging - app.logger.info("This is a log message"

Templates:
include below while extending
{% block content %}
{% endblock %}

- Templates directory is relative to app.py
- We can also specify Blueprint specific templtes directory

Add methods in route functions:
methods=['GET', 'POST']

DB:
# before initial run of app.py below command from location of app.py
# activate virtualenv
# export FLASK_APP=app.py
# flask db init
# flask db migrate -m "initial setup"
# flask db upgrade

form classes also contains valiadation checks and hence need to interact with DB using objects of Model classes

Always remember to add 'db.session.commit()'

Always do a DB migration after modifying model classes:
flask db migrate -m "changed table name"
flask db upgrade


Forms:
--------
-form.validate_on_submit() will not work without '{{ form.hidden_tag() }}' in html form.

- Field validation functions need have format validate_<field_name> as specified within flask-wtf
eg: def validate_username(self, field):
